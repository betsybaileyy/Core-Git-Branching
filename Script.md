As she moved slowly and walked behind the zoo she could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and heard the sounds of animals in the distance.
Sally had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, a sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
she stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Sally would leave it alone, but she was worried that an animal might escape.
she stuck her head in the door and saw a zookeeper. The color of the foliage was intensely green, brown and chartreuse, she called out for the zoo keeper but got no response.

After raising her voice to an uncomfortable level, she got the zoo keeper's attention.
